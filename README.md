# Artificial-Neural-Network-FPGA-Design-in-VHDL
This project implements a simple neuron model based on VHDL.The project aims to demonstrate the behavior of an artificial neuron, which processes inputs, computes weighted sums, and applies a sigmoid function to produce an output.  The design is intended for use on FPGA devices and is created using the Xilinx ISE toolchain.
